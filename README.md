# BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION
My main project is divided mainly into 5 main regions
# Data_description
This section contains three jupyter files
1) data_files which contains the list of all the data files.
2) data_features which contains all the features of my data which I have observed over a period of time. This section helps in developing a visual understanding of my dataset.
3) data_preprocessing which contains the code of preprocessing of my data 
# Model
This section contains a jupyter file which contains all the details about my model, its structure all the loss functions and as well as the metrics.
# Results
This section contains a jupyter file which showcases the results of my model on the test datset. All the visualisations of my model are present here.
# Features
This section contains all the graphs that contains my training history. This is used to measure the accuracy of my model trained and provide more insights.
# Project
Projects.ipynb is my main jupyter file which contains all the codes mentioned above, it is basically the entirety of my code. But since it is a fairly large file I created the above sections to help guide them through my project and look at the part they feel relevant and necessary. NOTE:- My project.ipynb file doesn't contain any comments. To get a better understanding of my code, I recommend you visit the other sections.
